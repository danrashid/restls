# restls

### A REST-like interface for localStorage

`restls` is designed as a temporary replacement for actual API calls through XHR libraries like [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). Itâ€™s most useful while developing single-page applications in isolation.

#### Installation

`yarn add restls`

#### Specs

The following fake HTTP methods are supported:

- `GET`
- `GETS` (a plural GET)
- `POST` (generates `{id: [UUIDv4], ...}` by default)
- `PUT`
- `PATCH`
- `DELETE`
- `DELETES` (a plural DELETE)

All return a Promise that resolves with `{ data: IBody | IBody[] }` or rejects with an error.

Every collection member is expected to have a unique `id` property.

#### Usage example

1.  Seed some data

```
setCollection("books", [
  {
    id: "b04ef13e-41bc-458c-abdd-7b1ae4bbece3",
    title: "Redburn: His First Voyage",
    author: "Herman Melville"
  },
  {
    id: "21c9ca51-089b-4816-90a0-56a1cc6534c1",
    title: "The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket",
    author: "Edgar Allan Poe"
  },
  {
    id: "327d1c1b-2c48-4e21-8d5d-493c3de9071a",
    title: "Moby-Dick; or, The Whale",
    author: "Herman Melville"
  }
]);
```

2.  Fetch some data

```
GET("books", { author: "Herman Melville" });
```

3.  Returns a Promise that resolves with:

```
{
  data: [
    {
      id: "b04ef13e-41bc-458c-abdd-7b1ae4bbece3",
      title: "Redburn: His First Voyage",
      author: "Herman Melville"
    },
    {
      id: "327d1c1b-2c48-4e21-8d5d-493c3de9071a",
      title: "Moby-Dick; or, The Whale",
      author: "Herman Melville"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Why are the function names in all-caps?

A couple reasons:

1.  Names in all-caps kinda align with the HTTP spec.
2.  (The real reason) `delete` is a (case-sensitive) reserved word and I thought any other word would be confusing.

### Dev commands

#### Compile as I change source files

`yarn watch`

#### Run tests as I change them

`yarn test --watch`

#### Generate a report about test coverage

`yarn test --coverage`

This generates a truly lovely HTML report in your ./coverage folder.
